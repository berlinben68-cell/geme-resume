# Cold Email Sequence for ExecGit

**Target Audience:** CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and Technical Managers in Dubai and Bangalore.
**Goal:** Book a 15-minute "Profile Audit".

## Email 1: The "Leaking Talent" Hook
**Subject:** Your GitHub profile is leaking talent

Hi [Name],

I’ve been following [Company Name]’s recent growth—impressive work on [Specific Project/News].

However, when I looked up your personal GitHub profile to see the technical leadership behind it, I found… silence.

In today’s market, top-tier developers don't just look at the company; they look at the *leader*. If the CTO looks technically inactive, the best talent assumes the culture is stagnant.

I’ve built a tool called **ExecGit** that solves this. It automates your technical presence (commits, code reviews, architecture diagrams) without taking a minute of your time.

Are you open to a 15-minute "Profile Audit" to see how we can turn your GitHub into a recruiting magnet?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 2: The "CTO Paradox" (Follow-up - 2 Days Later)
**Subject:** The CTO Paradox

Hi [Name],

The "CTO Paradox" is simple: The more successful you become at managing, the less you code. And the less you code, the harder it is to command respect from deep-tech engineering teams.

You shouldn't have to choose between leading and coding.

ExecGit acts as your "Technical Ghostwriter." It takes your high-level architectural ideas (voice notes) and converts them into active, impressive GitHub contributions.

It’s not faking it. It’s **delegating the implementation** so you can showcase the architecture.

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 3: The "Break Up" (Final Attempt - 4 Days Later)
**Subject:** Permission to close your file?

Hi [Name],

I’m guessing you’re either fully staffed with 10x engineers or just too busy building to worry about your personal brand right now.

I’ll close your file for now so I don't clutter your inbox.

If you ever decide you want to automate your technical authority, check out **ExecGit.com**.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
